# Anemia-Detection-using-eye-data-under-deep-learning
Anemia is a common blood disorder that can have serious health implications if left undetected.proposes an approach predicting analyzing eye condition
data using deep learning techniques. By neural networks the researchers aim correlations to indicate the presence of anemia. The use of deep learning allows for complex relationships to be captured and predictions to be made with a high degree of accuracy, model of eye images anemia status, the researchers seek to develop a reliable tool for early detection and monitoring of anemia. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of anemia, leading to improved health outcomes for individuals at risk.Key words â€“ Convolutional Neural network, Deep
